# ReactProj
A simple React project working with form validation, an error modal, arrays, and strengthening my understanding of props and state. 
I have also learned how to mesh components together the correct way so that they function the way they need to.
This form allows the user to input their name and age, and it will then add their information to a list displayed below the form.
